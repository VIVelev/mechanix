# mechanix

A small library of utilities to explore Classical Mechanics, heavily inspired by _scmutils_ presented
in the book [Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/6946/sicm-html/book.html)
by Sussman and Wisdom, and implemented in [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), taking advantage of the
awesome function transformations/compositions!

To get a quick overview, checkout the [examples/](examples/) folder (for instance the simple [pendulum example](examples/pendulum.py)),
or visit [In search of Hidden Conservation Laws](https://vivelev.xyz/hiddenLaws)
to see a cool demo of what the library is capable of!
